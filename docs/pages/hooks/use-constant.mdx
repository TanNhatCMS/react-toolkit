`useConstant` is a custom hook that creates a constant value over the lifecycle
of a component. Even if `useMemo` is provided an empty array as its final
argument, it doesn't offer a guarantee that it won't re-run for performance
reasons later on. By using `useConstant` you can ensure that initialisers don't
execute twice or more.

## Import

```js
import { useConstant } from '@dwarvesf/react-hooks'
```

## Return value

The `useMergeRefs` hook returns a function that receives the element and assign
the value to the given React refs.

## Usage

```jsx
function Example({ ref, ...props }) {
  const internalRef = React.useRef()
  const refs = useMergeRefs(internalRef, ref)

  return (
    <div {...props} ref={refs}>
      A div with multiple refs.
    </div>
  )
}
```

## Parameters

| Name    | Type                | Default | Description |
| ------- | ------------------- | ------- | ----------- |
| `value` | `any` \| `Function` | `_`     |             |
